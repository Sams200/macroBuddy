Hello,

This is my little project I've been working on for the past months.
It is an app used for tracking the food you eat and water you drink.
I'm very passionate about the gym and tracking your calories is a
very important part of any diet.

There are many apps like this on the play store, but they are either
full of ads, or have premium versions which do nothing more than
making some graphs here and there and making things look prettier.
This annoys me, since this whole thing is basically just a glorified
excel sheet, and it shouldn't be so difficult to make an app that does
exactly all of that, except it's completely free and has no annoying ads.

This project is not intended to be connected to the internet. Another
annoying thing about all those apps is that they require an internet
connection to get a large and frankly useless database filled with
junk. And without that internet connection they simply do not work.
This app isn't supposed to connect to the internet. Everything is stored
locally in the database, which is why there aren't multiple user types.

Things aren't 100% complete since I still don't understand how to connect
to the database smoothly, if this program is running on a completely new
machine. That part is handled in the Conn class, where the location, user,
and password should be given. There is also the Resources folder which
contains all the images I used so make sure to include that as well.
Oh and the config folder which contains a .txt with some stuff for the
daily totals.

You can create your own foods, entering the nutritional data, and then
you can group foods together into recipes. Then you can add entries in the
journal which can be either foods or recipes in different amounts, and
modify them later if needed. And you can also modify the water.
You can also set the total calories and macros you want to eat in a day
at the top of the page, and you can switch the date with the arrows or
date selector.

I hope the UI is intuitive enough. I tried to make it as pretty as I could,
and I made it all manually to show off my amazing swing skills :D. There are
some custom "buttons" on the entries themselves, and when youre creating an entry
or a recipe. These all have raised bevel borders. I had a lot of fun working
on this project, and though it's not completely done, I would like to finish
it during the second semester, or during the summer, and eventually port it
to android.

I would also like to mention that you have been a great teacher and I really
enjoyed this lab. I didn't think I would end up making an almost-complete
application in Java by the end, but here we are. Thank you very much.

Regards,
Suciu Andrei
