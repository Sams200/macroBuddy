# Description 

Calorie tracker written in Java, using JavaFX and PostgreSQL. The user can create foods and recipes, and add them to days in their journal, as well as setting calorie and macronutrient goals. The UI is dynamic, and can adapt to large amounts of entries in the database. 

# Implementation

As a requirement for the Databases course, a local database was used, written in PostgreSQL. Details can be found in repo/conn. In order to get it running, a local database should be created at the address in repo/conn, with the tables from the various repo classes.

All views were written manually as an exercise for me. This was my first time ever implementing any sort graphics based UI. I also used [Flatlaf](https://www.formdev.com/flatlaf/) as an easy way to improve the looks of the application. 

There is also a demo database in the files in this repository at /macroBuddyDatabase.sql
